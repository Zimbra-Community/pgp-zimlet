### Installing

    su zimbra
    cd /tmp
    rm tk_barrydegraaff_zimbra_openpgp*
    wget https://github.com/barrydegraaff/pgp-zimlet-binaries/raw/master/1.6.6/tk_barrydegraaff_zimbra_openpgp.zip
    zmzimletctl deploy tk_barrydegraaff_zimbra_openpgp.zip
    (wait 15 minutes for the deploy to propagate; or zmprov fc all && zmmailboxdctl restart)

Please be warned, if you undeploy this Zimlet after some time Zimbra will truncate your users preferences (public keys) of this Zimlet.

For debugging in production I recommend to disable the Zimlet via user preferences or via COS.

### About private key security

When you generate a private key with this zimlet or copy-paste it when signing or decrypting, it is NOT being send to the server and it is NOT stored on the server.

As of version 1.2.4 you can optionally store your private key in your browsers local storage. If you do not store your private key the server will ask you to provide it for each session. Also you can optionally store your passphrase to the Zimbra server. If you do not store your passphrase the server will ask you to provide it every time it is needed.

As of version 1.5.8 your private key is automatically encrypted with AES-256 when stored in your browsers local storage.
